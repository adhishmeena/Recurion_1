Calculate Power
Send Feedback
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.
Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
Constraints :
1 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30
Sample Input 1 :
 3 4
Sample Output 1 :
81
Sample Input 2 :
 2 5
Sample Output 2 :
32


//// main Code 

public class Solution {

	public static int power(int x, int n) {
        ;
        if (n==0){
            
            return 1;
        }
        
        int small_output=power(x,n-1);//hypothesis
        int  ans=small_output*x;
        
        return ans;
        
        
        
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
		 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
